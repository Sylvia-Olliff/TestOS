# Introduction
This is mostly boilerplate, and a lot of influence came from [OSDev.org](https://wiki.osdev.org)

## Where my code begins
Implementing understanding new line characters as well as properly scrolling the window. 
Building out the standard C library functions. <- This is where my simplicity focus comes in. I only intend to implement stdio.h, stdlib.h, and string.h for now. Thread related items may come later, but building out the C library to facilitate the addition of further functionality is the current focus. 

## Mandatory Features not yet implemented
Paging
Full Interrupt support. (or any for that matter)
Better memory map (including virtual)
System dumps, including registers current contents. (preferrably to a serial port)
add hex value handling to string printing
